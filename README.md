## Introduction
This is Part 1 of a project from the [British Airways Data Science micro-internship](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/british-airways/data-science-yqoz). British Airways is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom and is the second largest UK based carrier based on fleet size and passengers. British Airways has merged with Iberia, Spain's flag carrier airline, creating the International Airlines Group.

In this task, I take on the role of a junior data scientist employed at British Airways. British Airways has tasked me with collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third party source. I am also tasked with creating a predictive model to help determine which customers will book a flight for the upcoming holidays. **In this part of the project, I will collect customer feedback from a third party source, conduct data analysis and sentiment analysis, and present any insights on a PowerPoint slide.**
